my keyboard.. it broke. just because of a drama. i was deleting some parts of someones building as a joke on a free build, i didnt expect them to actually send death threats and making nsfw jokes out of me, the fact is the host. yes, the host. didnt cared alot, they have trust issues soo... they trusted the rude people. and oh well, during the drama, they keep blaming it on me and start sending nsfw jokes made out of me. i smashed my keyboard, so HARD than the way i want to hit the character i hate so much. and so, guess what. no explanation needed. just look at the image.

<!-- sorry but i have to. -->
